# LambertW-Infinite-Exponential-Tower-Fractal-Generator
<h1> Welcome to a Western Univeristy USRI project! Here is are the steps to create your own Lambert W picture </h1>

<h2> You need C++, g++, mpfr and gmp modules instealled in your compiler while for Python you need the modules sys, csv, numpy, tracemalloc, time, pickle, matplotlib, random, colorsys and multiprocessing</h2> 

- &nbsp; Go to MAIN.cpp, change the settings to what you want and build the MAIN.exe file using the following command "g++  MAIN.cpp -o MAIN -lmpfr -lgmp"
- &nbsp; Run the MAIN.exe file, this will take some time depending on your computer and the settings you have picked. 
- &nbsp; Once MAIN.exe file is finished running, go to CompletedTest2.ipynb and set the same settings as you have in MAIN.cpp and run everything.
- &nbsp; You can see the image on jupyter but the if your picture is of higher quality than 2000, it is better to directly see it by downloading the picture located in Images/ and seeing it on your computer
